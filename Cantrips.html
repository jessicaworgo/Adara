	<p><b><u>Dancing Lights:</u></b> <i>Casting Time- 1 action, Range- 120 feet, Components- V/S/M (a bit of phosphorous or wychwood, or a glow worm), Duration- Up to 1 Minute.</i> You create up to 4 torch sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds this spells range.</p>
	<p><b><u>Fire Bolt:</u></b> <i>Casting Time- 1 action, Range-120 feet , Component- V/S, Duration- Instantaneous.</i> You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1D10 fire damage. A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn’t being worn or carried. The spells damage increases by 1D10 when you reach 5th level (2D10), 11th level(3D10), and 17th level(4D10).</p>
	<p><b><u>Light:</u></b> <i>Casting Time- 1 action, Range- touch, Component- V/M (a firefly or phosphorescent moss), Duration- 1 hour.</i> You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20 foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action. If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.</p>
	<p><b><u>Poison Spray:</u></b> <i>Casting Time- 1 action, Range- 10 feet, Component- V/S, Duration- Instantaneous.</i> You extend your hand towards a creature you can see within range and project a puff of noxious gas from your palm. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1D12 poison damage. This spell’s damage increases by 1D12 when you reach 5th level (2D12), 11th level (3D12), and 17th level (4D12).</p>
	<p><b><u>Prestidigitation:</u></b> <i>Casting Time- 1 action, Range- 10 feet, Component- V/S, Duration- Up to 1 hour.</i> This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spell casters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:
		<ul>
			<li>You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.</li>
			<li>You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.</li>
			<li>You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.</li>
			<li>You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.</li>
			<li>You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.</li>
			<li>You create a non-magical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.</li>
		</ul>
	If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can diminish such an effect as an action.</p>
