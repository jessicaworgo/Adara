	<p><b><u>Burning Hands:</u></b> <i>Casting Time- 1 action, Range- Self (15 foot cone), Components- V/S, Duration- Instantaneous.</i> As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3D6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried. At higher levels, when you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1D6 for each slot level above 1st. </p>
	<p><b><u>Comprehend Languages:</u></b> <i>Casting Time- 1 action, Range- Self, Components- V/S/M ( a pinch of soot and salt), Duration- 1 hour.</i> For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear. You also understand any written language you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes about 1 minute to read 1 page of text. This spell doesn’t decode secret messages in a text or glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn’t part of a written language.</p>
	<p><b><u>Magic Missile:</u></b> <i>Casting time- 1 action, Range- 120 feet, Components- V/S, Duration- Instantaneous.</i> You create 3 glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see within range. Each dart deals 1D4+1 force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously and you can direct them to hit one creature or several. <b>At higher levels=</b> when you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd or higher, the spell creates one more dart for each level above 1st.</p>
	<p><b><u>Witch Bolt:</u></b> <i>Casting Time- 1 action, Range- 30 feet, Components- V/S/M (a twig from a tree that has been struck by lightning), Duration- Concentration, up to 1 minute.</i> A beam of crackling, blue energy lances out toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target. Make a ranged spell attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes 1D12 lightning damage, and on each of the turns for your duration, you can use your action to deal 1D12 lightning damage to the target automatically. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the spell’s range or it has total cover from you.</p>
